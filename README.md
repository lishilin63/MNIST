# MNIST Multi-Layer Perceptron
Deep Learning (Understanding Images)

MNIST is a database of handwritten digits available on http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/. EMNIST is an extended MNIST database https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset.

In the project, we built out a Multi Layer Perceptron model to try to classify hand written digits using TensorFlow.

The images which we worked with are black and white images of size 28 x 28 pixels, or 784 pixels total. Our features are the pixel values for each pixel. Either the pixel is "white" (blank with a 0), or there is some pixel value.

We tried to correctly predict what number is written down based solely on the image data in the form of an array. This type of problem (Image Recognition) is a great use case for Deep Learning Methods.
